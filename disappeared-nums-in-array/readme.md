# Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Leetcode [problem 448](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/); **Difficulty:** `Easy`

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return _an array of all the integers in the range_ `[1, n]` _that do not appear in_ `nums`.

## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

## Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`

**Output:** `[5,6]`

## Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,1]`

**Output:** `[2]`

## Follow up:

Could you do it without extra space and in `O(n)` runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
