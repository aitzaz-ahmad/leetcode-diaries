# Symmetric Tree

Leetcode [problem 101](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/); **Difficulty:** `Easy`

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100)`

## Example 1:
